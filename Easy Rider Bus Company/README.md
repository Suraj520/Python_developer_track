# About the Project
> > This is the implementation of the Project- Easy Rider Bus Company on Python Developer Track on Github
    Link to the Project's Problem Statement: https://hyperskill.org/projects/128/

> > You've just been hired by a bus company that started actively using the Internet for business. Before you came, their database had been updated a few times by various employees with various levels of skill. Your task is to find all the mistakes they made in the database. Good news: you have documentation, but bad news: it's incomplete. This promises to be quite an investigation!

> >  The software is built with the incomplete information served in the task. Refer Documentation.jpg and Diagram_of_the_bus_line.jpg file which were served as input for the task.
