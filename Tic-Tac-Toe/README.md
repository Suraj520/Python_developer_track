Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. 
### About the Software version
This simulates a tic-tac-toe game where iteratively two users play the game to have the outcome of Win, Loss or Draw.
